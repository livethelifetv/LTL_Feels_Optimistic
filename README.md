# GEB

This repository contains the core smart contract code for the whole GEB system ported to Optimistic Ethereum. GEB is the abbreviation of [GÃ¶del, Escher and Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) as well as the name of an [Egyptian god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geb).

Check out the more in-depth [documentation](https://docs.reflexer.finance/).

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Please make sure you've installed the following before continuing:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If you'd like to test the contracts against a local Optimism node, you can install the node by doing the following (in a separate terminal):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
cd optimism
yarn install
yarn build
cd ops
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Before running any command in this repo, make sure to install all dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ yarn compile
```

Compile against Optimism:

```sh
$ yarn compile:network optimism
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain artifacts:

```sh
$ yarn typechain
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ yarn lint:ts
```

### Test

Run the tests against Ethereum:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

Or against your local Optimism node:

```sh
$ yarn test:network optimism
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ yarn coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true yarn test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ yarn clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to an Ethereum network:

```sh
$ yarn deploy
```

Deploy the contracts to a specific network, such as Optimism (local, testnet or mainnet, depending on your setup):

```sh
$ yarn deploy:network optimism
```

## Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can enjoy syntax highlighting for your Solidity code via the
[vscode-solidity](https://github.com/juanfranblanco/vscode-solidity) extension. The recommended approach to set the
compiler version is to add the following fields to your VSCode user settings:

```json
{
  "solidity.compileUsingRemoteVersion": "v0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2",
  "solidity.defaultCompiler": "remote"
}
```

Where of course `v0.8.4+commit.c7e474f2` can be replaced with any other version.
